Achieving the necessary scale for macro-algae farming, 
requires a shift in technology. [KelpBioChar][KBWeb]
core function is growing kelp on our custom drones.

## Kelp Drones
A single Kelp Drone is made up of three or more [Species Occurrence Units][SOMU],
a 1 meter by 1 meter where kelp is grown and managed. The Kelp drone is
powered by a hosted large langauge model (LLM) that together coordinate with
other kelp drones.

Our kelp drones organize in pods, ranging in size from 3 up 
to 30 drones. Multiple pods form into larger groups, called forests,

Our inital designs are available under open source licenses while
we offer both free and commerical LLMs for other who want to use our 
kelp bed designs. [More information here]().
